## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-resume-generator
npm install
```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Run the database setup scripts in the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of sql/simple-setup.sql
-- Copy and paste and run the 09-comprehensive-rpc-functions.sql
-- This creates all necessary tables, functions, and triggers
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧩 Chrome extension

Side panel with login, assigned profiles, and resume generation. Config is baked from `.env` when you build.

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

Then Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → Load unpacked → `extension/` folder.

See [`extension/README.md`](./extension/README.md).
